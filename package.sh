ClaudeUsageBar - Install
========================

ClaudeUsageBar shows your Claude.ai usage limits in the macOS menu bar. It has
two parts: the menu bar app and a browser extension. You need both.


1. Install the menu bar app
---------------------------
- Drag ClaudeUsageBar.app onto the Applications folder in this window.
- Open Applications and launch ClaudeUsageBar (right-click > Open the first
  time if macOS warns about an unidentified developer).
- Allow notifications when asked (used to warn you near your limit).
- It appears in the menu bar with no Dock icon, showing "Claude --" until the
  extension sends data.


2. Install the browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc)
-----------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: first copy the Extension folder OUT of this disk image to a permanent
location, e.g. your home folder or Documents. An unpacked extension must stay on
disk - if you load it from this disk image it breaks as soon as the image is
ejected.

- Drag the "Extension" folder from this window to, say, your Documents folder.
- Open chrome://extensions in your browser.
- Turn on "Developer mode" (top right).
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the Extension folder you just copied.
- Open or reload a logged-in https://claude.ai tab.


That's it
---------
The menu bar starts updating within a minute. It reads your usage from your own
logged-in claude.ai session and sends it only to 127.0.0.1 on your own machine.
Keep one claude.ai tab open; the usage settings page does NOT need to be open.

To start the app automatically at login: menu bar icon > Settings > Start at
login (works best once the app lives in /Applications).
